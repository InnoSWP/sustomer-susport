# Seamless Customer Support

An open-source web-application easily embeddable into customer's service for seamless usability both for clients (people who ask the questions) and volunteers (people who answer questions)

For that purpose we provide 
- embeddable (via iframe) website
- API for bots
- semantical text parsing (to recognize already asked questions and show answers for them)
